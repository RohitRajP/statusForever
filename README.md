# üî• Status Forever üî•

Have you ever seen that one status your WhatsApp friend posts, which you wish to procure but just can't seem to get at it? ü§î

Either it is a video that is difficult to save, or it is an image that loses its quality when screenshotted.

Status forever‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, is a beautifully designed application that will help you download and share any media status posted by your friends/mates in your WhatsApp feed and save it as per the contact posting them. üòÉ

## Acknowledgments

* A big thanks to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [Google Flutter docs](https://flutter.dev/docs) and random but highly helpful youtube videos
* This idea got it's inspiration from me almost being banned from [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) due to using the modded version GBWhatsapp, which had this status saving feature that I used a lot.
However, the apps available in the market were completely filled with ads and poor UI/UX, which is why I set out to create my own version.
* There are multiple alternatives for the same functionality available in the market, but almost all of them lack the detailed and well designed engineering of [StatusForever](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.a011.statusforever&hl=en), which I believe is the USP of the product.
